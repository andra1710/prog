My student ID ends with 79 and since 79%23 = 10, i got exam Examination project 10:  Adaptive 1D integrator with random nodes .
I have implementet a 1D integrator with random nodes and compared three integrals calculated with my implementet random apporch to its exact answer.
I Then changed the number of new points thrown at each iteration to find the optimum number.
Lastly I compare my random integrator with the recursive adaptive integrator from quadratures homework Part A.
